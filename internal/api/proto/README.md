# Generated Protocol Buffer and gRPC Code

The code in this directory should not be checked into version control. It
is generated automatically by the protocol buffer compiler (`protoc`).

Run the shell script `{project}/scripts/protoc-gen.sh` from the project's
root directory to generate the necessary files.
